## Introduction
1. Basic Three.js Concepts
    -	Scene: The container for all objects, lights, and cameras, defining all elements in the 3D space.
    -	Camera: Determines the viewing perspective of the scene. Common types are PerspectiveCamera and OrthographicCamera.
    -	Renderer: Responsible for rendering the scene to the screen, usually using WebGLRenderer.
```js
renderer.render(scene, camera);
```
2. Creating 3D Objects
    - Geometry: The shape of objects, such as BoxGeometry, SphereGeometry, PlaneGeometry, RingGeometry, etc.
    - Material: Defines the appearance of objects (color, texture, etc.), commonly used are MeshBasicMaterial, MeshLambertMaterial, MeshStandardMaterial, etc.
    - Mesh: A combination of geometry and material, representing an actual 3D object.
```js
const sphere = new THREE.Mesh(sphereGeometry, sphereMaterial);
```
3. Lights
    - AmbientLight: Illuminates the entire scene uniformly.
    - PointLight: Emits light from a point in all directions.
    - DirectionalLight: Emits parallel light rays from a direction, similar to sunlight.
    - SpotLight: Emits a cone-shaped beam of light from a point.
    - Shadows: Enable shadow effects to increase realism, involving casting shadows (castShadow) and receiving shadows (receiveShadow).
```js
const pointLight = new THREE.PointLight(0xffffff, 1, 1000);
pointLight.position.set(2, 2, 5);
scene.add(pointLight);
```
4. Camera Controls
    - OrbitControls: Allows users to interact by rotating, zooming, and panning the camera with the mouse, commonly used in interactive 3D scenes on the web.
```js
// Set up OrbitControls (for mouse interaction)
const controls = new OrbitControls(camera, renderer.domElement);
controls.enableDamping = true; // Smooth movement
controls.dampingFactor = 0.25; // Damping factor for smoother controls
controls.screenSpacePanning = false; // Disables up/down movement
```
