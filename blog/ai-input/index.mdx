import AIInput from './components/ai-input';

<AIInput />

## Basic Concepts
AIInput is a component that can collect user input and handle it, just like the plain text and some attachments which selected by some other actions

The actions is flexible, just like upload files, select tools, etc.

```tsx
type CoreInputProps = {
    onSend: (value: string, attachments: Attachment[]) => void;
    attachmentRender: (value: string, onSelect: (attactment: Attachment) => void) => JSX.Element;
    attachmentDisplayer: (attachments: Attachment[], onClick: () => void) => JSX.Element;
    attachmentHandler?: (attactment: Attachment, setAttachments: React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<Attachment[]>>) => void;
}
```
