## Currying

Currying is a technique of converting a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions that each take a single argument.

**In short: Using the characteristics of higher-order functions, the function is partially called according to the parameters.**

### Currying Function

:::tip
Use the **curry** from the lodash library to curry the function add, and get **curriedAdd**
:::

```js
import { curry } from "lodash";

const add = (p1, p2, p3) => p1 + p2 + p3;

const curriedAdd = curry(add);
```

:::tip
Call with full arguments to get the final result

```js
curriedAdd(1, 2, 3); // 6
curriedAdd(1)(2)(3); // 6
```

Call with partial arguments to get another functional function curriedAdd100, a function that adds 100

```js
const curriedAdd100 = curriedAdd(100);
curriedAdd100(2, 3); // 105
```

Before all arguments are called, the returned are all corresponding functional functions

```js
const curriedAdd105 = curriedAdd100(5);
curriedAdd105(10); // 115
```

:::

## Compose

Compose functions, compose pure functions. For example, a function: f(x) = x^2

The composed functions are like pipelines, executed sequentially from right to left (by default), processing the data.

```js
import * as R from "ramda";

const arr = [{ name: "a" }, { name: "b" }];
// Use compose to arrange appropriate functions to get the data `A.B`

const func1 = R.compose(
  R.join("."),
  R.map(R.compose(R.toUpper, R.prop("name")))
);

console.log(func1(arr)); // expected: A.B
```
:::tip
The various functions used in the above example from the ramda library are all curried. By composing various methods with compose, a new function that can achieve the target functionality is obtained.
