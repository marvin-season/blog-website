## Basic Concepts
AIInput is a component that can collect user input and handle it.

```tsx
type CoreInputProps = {
    onSend: (value: string, attachments: Attachment[]) => void;
    attachmentRender: (value: string, onSelect: (attactment: Attachment) => void) => JSX.Element;
    attachmentDisplayer: (attachments: Attachment[], setAttachments: AttachmentSetter) => JSX.Element;
    attachmentHandler?: (attactment: Attachment, setAttachments: AttachmentSetter) => void;
}
```

{/* truncate  */}
